				<h2>Premium Pro Service</h2>
				<p>ServiceMagic Ltd [SM] offers a matching service that allows service providers and suppliers (the Partners) to obtain the details of individuals and corporate entities (the Customers) who have requested to be matched with one or more service providers (a Service Request), allowing Customers to find one or more Partners to fulfil a Service Request.</p>
				<p>These Terms and Conditions (T&amp;Cs) govern Partner's use of the SM services.</p>
				<p>The service offered by SM is a simple one of matching Customers to Partners, allowing the Partners to find Customers, and Customers to find one or more Partners as part of a Service Request.</p>
				<p>Partners using the matching service offered by SM and visiting the SM sites (ServiceMagic.co.uk, 123GetAQuote.co.uk) acknowledge having read and accepted these T&amp;Cs.</p>
				<ol>
					<li>SM undertakes to send the Partner only Service Requests relating to the geographical coverage and business (Profile) determined by the Partner.</li>
					<li>SM undertakes to check the quality of Service Requests before sending them to its Partner and to delete any Service Request that would be considered to be unreliable by SM.</li>
					<li>SM undertakes to provide the Partner with sufficient information on the Customer to enable the Partner to contact the Customer directly. SM undertakes to send details of each Service Request to no more than five Partners. SM is free to contract with other Partners as this is not an exclusive contract.</li>
					<li>Whenever SM sends a Customer's details to the Partner, the Partner agrees to pay a fixed sum (a Lead Fee) for each Service Request as set out in the Pricing List in force at the time these T&amp;Cs are accepted by the Partner or, for Partners who have pre-paid for a batch of contact-credits, to be debited with the corresponding number of contact-credits.</li>
					<li>The Partner acknowledges and agrees that the number of Service Requests that SM will be able to provide to the Partner will vary and is not guaranteed and that SM cannot guarantee that the number of Service Requests it is able to send to the Partner will allow the Partner to achieve the monthly budget fixed by Partner. Further, SM does not guarantee that a Partner will be engaged by any Consumer pursuant to a Service Request. SM provides only consumer leads to Partners, not guaranteed business.</li>
					<li>The Partner may change its Profile at any time. SM undertakes to make all changes requested by the Partner within a maximum period of two (2) business days. However, SM reserves the right to reject any substantial change requested by the Partner. In such cases, SM will notify the Partner of its rejection within a period of two (2) business days, and the Partner may thereafter cancel or suspend membership of the service in the terms set out in this document. If Partner does not cancel or suspend its membership, then Partner will continue to receive Service Requests based upon its then existing Profile.</li>
					<li>The Partner may increase its monthly budget at any time on the SM website or by telephoning Customer Service during working hours. In the latter case, an increase in the monthly budget will become effective only once written confirmation is received by email or fax. The Partner may at any time reduce its monthly budget on the SM website or by telephoning Customer Service during working hours (in the latter case, a decrease in the monthly budget will become effective only once written confirmation is received by email or fax), provided that the Partner remains accountable and agrees to be debited with sums payable on the day on which it reduces its monthly budget.</li>
					<li>The Partner acknowledges and agrees that it is responsible for ensuring that the contact information and any other details regarding Partner that it has provided to SM are correct and kept up to date so that it can receive the Service Requests from SM. SM is not liable or accountable for Service Requests not received by the Partner, and Partner agrees to pay for all Service Requests delivered to the contact information provided by Partner.</li>
					<li>For Partners who have not prepaid a batch of contact-credits, SM undertakes to email a monthly detailed account Statement to the Partner at the end of each month. The Partner acknowledges and agrees that it will not receive a Statement until it has provided SM with a valid email address. The Partner agrees that payment of the balance due will be made by SM processing the Partner's credit/debit card on the 1st, 8th, 16th and 24th of each month. For Partners who have pre-paid a batch of contact-credits, SM undertakes to email a Statement within two (2) business days following prepayment for the contact-credit batch.</li>
					<li>SM is not entitled to receive any commission on any amounts paid by Customers to Partners for services performed by Partners. The Lead Fee payable or the contact-credit due from the Partner to SM for each Service Request is not dependant on whether or not the Partner is engaged to perform services by the Customer. Lead Fees and contact-credits are earned upon delivery of the Customer's details from SM to Partner.</li>
					<li>SM undertakes to re-credit the Partners for any Service Request for which SM confirms one of the following:
						<ol>
							<li>the details correspond to those of a Customer for which the Partner has already received the same details and request through a prior Service Request received by SM within the previous 30 days (DUPLICATE),</li>
							<li>the Customer's telephone number is wrong and prevents the Partner from contacting the Customer by telephone (WRONG TELEPHONE),</li>
							<li>the description does not match the form on which it has been entered by the Customer, provided that the form on which it should have been entered does not match the Partner Profile (FORM ERROR),</li>
							<li>the postcode of the place where the service is to be provided is wrong, provided that the postcode that should have been entered does not match the Partner Profile (LOCATION ERROR), or</li>
							<li>the description is totally fictitious and inaccurate in SMs sole determination (FICTITIOUS REQUEST).</li>
						</ol>
					</li>
					<li>In order to be re-credited pursuant to Section 11 above, the Partner must submit a substantiated request in writing, using the interface provided by SM, within seven (7) days of the day on which the Service Request is received. SM shall have the right, in its sole discretion, to determine whether re-crediting is warranted.</li>
					<li>To be able to benefit from the service offered by SM, the Partner undertakes to:
						<ol type="a">
							<li>contact Customers as soon as Service Requests are received,</li>
							<li>provide estimates free of charge and, where applicable, obtain the Customer's prior consent if the level of expenditure incurred by providing the estimate are such that the Customer needs to be invoiced,</li>
							<li>observe the commitments and time limits indicated on the estimates and agreements between Partner and Customers,</li>
							<li>observe all applicable regulations and standards applicable,</li>
							<li>observe all applicable tax and social laws,</li>
							<li>be recorded or registered as required with the applicable authorities,</li>
							<li>be up-to-date at all times with compulsory insurance essential to its business,</li>
							<li>possess the qualifications and necessary expertise to provide the services that it has selected in its Profile,</li>
							<li>contact Customers itself,</li>
							<li>provide and invoice the services itself,</li>
							<li>invoice services in accordance with the estimate initially submitted to the Customer,</li>
							<li>provide quality services to meet Customers' requirements as far as possible,</li>
							<li>provide a quality after-sales service,</li>
							<li>provide services within England, Scotland or Wales.</li>
						</ol>
					</li>
					<li>Any failure to meet any of the commitments listed in the above article may result in immediate suspension or cancellation of the Partner's Account, without any entitlement to a refund of any sums previously paid by the Partner to SM.</li>
					<li>SM will not under any circumstances be liable for any sum resulting from any dispute between the Customer and the Partner as part of a Partner's contract with, or of a Partner's provision of services for, a Customer. SM will not be held liable, and Partner releases SM from any liability, in any dispute that may subsequently arise between the Customer and the Partner regarding Partner's performance of or failure to perform services for the Customer.</li>
					<li>SM is not involved in, nor does SM have any responsibility for Partners contracts with Customers, or any payments to Partners from Customers or any disputes Partners may have with Customers. Notwithstanding anything in these T&amp;Cs to the contrary, SM does not make guarantees, representations or warranties regarding a Customer's level of interest, their desire to have work completed, their creditworthiness or ability to pay Partners, the accuracy of the information provided by the Customers, or that any Customers will hire Partners to perform services, nor does SM guarantee that Partners will successfully contact each Customer.</li>
					<li>These T&amp;Cs are not transferable or assignable by Partner. Furthermore, the transfer of Service Requests received by the Partner to third parties, whether free of charge or for a consideration, or to other service providers or suppliers, is strictly prohibited and is contrary to current regulations concerning confidentiality of personal data. Any transfer by Partner of Service Requests to third parties may result in legal proceedings and the termination of Partner's account with SM.</li>
					<li>With regard to pre-payment of a batch of contact-credits, contact-credits pre-paid by Partners may be used for a period of 12 months from the date of payment for such contact-credits (the Validity Period). At the end of the Validity Period, unused contact-credits will be forfeited by Partner and definitively withdrawn from the Partner's account unless the Partner purchases new contact-credits before the end of the Validity Period, in which case the new expiry date for all contact-credits will be 12 months from the most recent date of purchase of a batch of contact-credits, or unless the Partner has received less than 200 Service Requests during the period of validity of its contact-credits, in which case the period of validity will be extended by 12 months. In all cases, contact-credits pre-paid by a Partner will not be refunded during or after the Validity Period for any reason whatsoever.</li>
					<li>Beyond the 30-day integration period as from the date of your acceptance of these T&amp;Cs, the Partner may cancel or suspend its membership of the service offered by SM by registered letter with confirmation of delivery or by fax. Upon receipt of a request for cancellation or suspension is received, SM shall suspend the delivery of Service Requests to Partner within  a maximum period of two (2) business days. The Partner acknowledges and agrees that it will be obliged to pay for all Service Requests that may have been sent to it before the effective date of cancellation or suspension of the Partner account and that cancellation or suspension of its account will make all sums owed by the Partner to SM at the effective date of cancellation of the Partner account immediately payable. During the 30-day integration period, membership may not be cancelled or suspended by Partner except in the case of force majeure.</li>
					<li>SM reserves the right to refuse a membership request for Partnership for any reason or no reason, without having to state reasons. Moreover, SM reserves the right at any time and even within the integration period to exclude a Partner who has failed to observe these T&amp;Cs, without prior notice or having to give reasons, and without being required to refund any amounts previously paid.</li>
					<li>The Partner acknowledges and agrees that it will be liable for an administration charge of &#163;40 including VAT to cover bank charges and costs resulting from any incident or failure of the Partner to pay Lead Fees or contact-credits when due. SM may also charge interest at the rate of two percent per month on any overdue payments by the Partner from the date payment became due until actual payment is made.</li>
					<li>The Pricing List and T&amp;Cs applicable are those current on the day on which this document is confirmed by the Partner. SM reserves the right to change its Pricing List and T&amp;Cs at any time. Partner's sole remedy if it does not agree to such a change shall be to terminate this Agreement. If Partner fails to terminate this Agreement, then this Agreement shall continue in full force and effect as modified by SM in the notice provided to Partner.</li>
					<li>SM's name, trademarks and logos and the contents of websites published by SM are SM's exclusive property and cannot in any event be used or reproduced in any way without SM's prior consent in writing.
